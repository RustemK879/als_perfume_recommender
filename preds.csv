"the scent of honeysuckles envelopes you with this fragrance. many say it is sophisticated? however, i find it to be innocent. it reminds of a late spring day when the scent of honeysuckles lingers in the air. this is my favorite of the three muses.",4.0

"this is a subtle dry (not sweet) floral scent. it smells old fashioned, but is not 'old'. it reminds me of anais anais from the '80's without being overwhelming. it does not last very long on me so i combine it with other scents. it is very soft and does not have one or another pronounced single note. sort of a bouquet of flowers that is balanced.",2.0
"an older woman, 60's, was wearing this perfume, i told her i loved it. she later gave me her bottle with a little remaining, just so i could try it. love it. that was when i was 35, i am now late 50's and still this is my all time favorite perfume.",4.0

"the scent of this perfume is absolutely heavenly. i have worn coco mademoiselle for years and thought that i'd never use anything else. then several years ago, i got introduced to quelques fleurs, and now i can't live without this perfume. this really is a classy, sexy, elegant and just beautiful perfume. i always get asked what perfume i am wearing. i highly recommend this perfume.",4.0
"this fragrance is heavenly. i wear it for all occasions and receive many compliments. quelques fleurs was one of princess diana's favorite perfumes. in fact, it was the scent she wore on her wedding day. we all know what a class act she was, right down to her choice of perfumes !",4.0

i have used emeraud for years and love it. just found where i can order a new bottle.,4.0
"i tend to stick with the fragrances from years and years ago because they are classic and last long..i had never tried this one, not even when i was young....well, i ordered and it is definatley unique...soft with sandlewood...not musky at all....it does stand out from any other fragrance i have...i mainly use it during the day....night time too ....its more amplified after a shower",4.0

"ooh,this is a heavenly fragrance,it has that retro vibe to it that i love. nobody has ever heard of cerruti 1881 before so i'm glad i've chosen the right one for all my special events. there's absolutely nothing bad,whatsoever,to say about it. just love it.",4.0
"i have worn this fragrance for 10+ years and have constant compliments on how lovely is its scent! i hope it will be around indefinitely because it is reasonably priced and is also not an offensive, cloying type of fragrance. it is one of the few i am not allergic to.",4.0
a friend gave me this as a gift when she can home from europe and i fell in love with this at 1st. wear. have used it ever since. ( 15 years ) cerruti 1881.,4.0
"there are no words to describe how stunningly beautiful this fragrance is. i've never heard of cerutti 1881 until a friend bought it back from a caribbean cruise just for me. i certainly agree with both of the reviews here,this is one fragrance guaranteed to get you noticed. i love it.",4.0
cerrutti 1881 orange is absolutely devine. its one fragrance you will wear and love yourself while feeling confident at the same time.,4.0
"i am using cerutti over 10 years ! believe me, cerutti perfume is always impressing, mesmerizing and has no end for consuming by any age of women. even more: one day one young girl came to me and she said ""you smell like my mom"", her face was soooooo happy !! i think that would be the best description for a successful fragrance!",4.0
does it smell like the obsession or is it stronger. .,2.0
"obsession night ,is one of my favorite perfumes ! i always get compliments and many hours after i put it on ..",4.0
"every time i wear this at the office, someone always compliments the fragrance.",4.0
"i am a perfume enthusiast. i got a sample of the gucci guilty fragrances as a free gift from a previous perfume order. i loved every sample and i became drawn to the guilty because of the powdery extremely feminite appeal. i have a preference for sweet smells because sweet, oriental, floral fruity smells. i was uneasy about ordering the intense because some of the reviews say that the perfumes are different. i love the gamble and this perfume is own full swag. when i walk i can small the powdery notes.",4.0
i purchased the gucci guilty intense fragrance earlier this year for my girlfriend and she loves it. just a little dab of it lasts her all day and it is by far her favorite fragrance,4.0
i have been using noa since 1998. i stopped briefly because it was no longer sold in canada. i was so relieved to have found it here and order it regularly! i literally cannot wear another scent!! i absolutely love it!! so thankful to you for carrying it!! :))),4.0
"i came across this perfume in a small out of the way chemist in brisbane, noa in our language (nz maori) means ""to be at peace"". then i sprayed my wrists and it was love at first whiff and it brought all of my memories of my home to me. i have been using for 15 years alas it is getting difficult to find a supplier. if i could afford to i would buy your remaing stock.",4.0
"i was never a perfume lady until i tried this scent at the mall. pure by alfred sung just completely changed my outlook on perfume in general,and the salesgirl was so convincing that she even gave me the sample for free until i decided whether to buy it or not. so nice of her. then two days later,i bought it and now i'm loving it. light,fresh,simply wonderful scent.",4.0
"i have been wearing this fragrance for a very long time. i wear it everyday and always get a few comments on how nice i smell. i appreciate that - not over powering, re-freshing and a keeper.",4.0
"i tried pure by alfred sung based on the reviews i saw here and i must say,i'm really impressed by this soft whisper of a scent. it worked wonders with my chemistry because i sometimes tend to smell very easily in crowded areas & i don't want to knock anyone out with my body odor. i even combine it with talcum powder to make it last a bit longer.",4.0

i am so thrilled to have found vanilla fields on this website. i have wore it for the past 25 years and was getting worried when all the department stores quit offering it for customers. i have tried so many designer brands no matter what the costs and vanilla fields is the only perfume for me. i get so so many compliments when i wear it. please do not ever discontinue carrying this perfume. i get paid once a month and that is when i will be ordering.,4.0

i'd give dkny fresh blossom six stars if i could. it's absolutely the perfect scent for spring and summer. i'm using this for a cousin's outdoor wedding and a friend's upcoming graduation.,4.0
"i love the smell of cabotine. it leaves a soft,lingering feminine scent on my clothes even if i give them a light wash. i get a few occasional comments on it. some people find the scent quite youthful while others find it a bit old fashioned. well,that's why it's called a classic,is it not? want to smell unique & feminine like me? try cabotine today.",4.0
"bought this for my wife. she loves it. she usually wears jimmy choo, but loves this particular version of juicy. not a bad price either.",4.0

"such a beautiful scent with a cranberry, champegne smell. it lasts long and i receive compliments on it all the time. lovely smell for evenings or night outs. definitely recommend!",4.0
"i bought my 1st bottle of cartier la panthere in paris. surprisingly the paris purchase was double the cost that i've paid on this web site. love this fragrance, and also many other cartier perfumes. i find that the fragrance does not linger. i purchased the body lotion and this helps maintain the perfume scent.",4.0
"cartier la panthere is a very different fragrance from what i usually am drawn to. it is a mature fragrance that manages to be light and deep at the same time. the dry down seems to really bring out the oakmoss, and i typically prefer something sweeter. i'm still getting used to it but i'm pretty happy with this new addition to my collection. the bottle design is by far my absolute favorite in my collection.",4.0
i love this smell. it lasts all day and i have been complimented on it many times throughout the day which proves to me it's long-lasting. it smells very clean. one of my favorite fragrances from france =),4.0
it smells like lancome's magie noir.,0.0
i have been a perfume collector for many years but when i found cartier la panthere... i said this is my signature scent because people always ask me what am i wearing. to piggy back off that last comment your right you'll be remembered!,4.0
i just randomly picked this fragrance up and instantly fell in love!,4.0
"love this fragrance. it's elegant, but not overwhelming",4.0
the prada candy kiss is my signiture sent and its my favoriteof all time i will use it till i no longer can,4.0
prada kiss has a flowery scent that is classy and feminine. the scent gets noticed.,3.0
vanilla musk by coty is simply delicious. great for any occasion. not over powering. last about 4-5 hours. i find that i spritz a bit more on around mid day. i like it so no problem. i'm on my 4th bottle. i wish that it came larger than 1.oz. i have to order 2 at a time. :0),4.0
very lovely scent. almost similar to dulce vanilla or dark vanilla which coty stopped making. it could do with a little more lasting power or at least make a body lotion to it. vanilla musk is the best.,4.0
"if you're looking for the ideal fragrance that will suit your everyday needs,look no further than vanilla musk by coty. this light,refreshing scent made my work days a bit better and for the price,how could i not try it? sorry guys,but the 1 oz and .375 oz bottles are simply not enough here. please consider making the bigger sized bottles and we'll continue doing business with you all. thanks a bunch.",3.0
"i'm glad i purchased vanilla musk,because it's the ideal scent that doesn't knock people out or choke the living daylights out of them. you could say i'm an 'au naturel' kind of lady,& i'm very picky in my choice of perfumes. i was also surprised to learn that this has been around since 1994,around the same time as my other fave vanilla fields. well,i hope they won't ever let this one go in 2016. gonna stock up on this a.s.a.p.",4.0
"this smells a hint like perry ellis 360. but then again i guess it depends on the body chemistry...i do like the clean , fresh smell ..kind of like soap and flowers!...its a pleasant clean scent.",3.0
"o.m.g., i love this fragrance (splendor). i had never heard of it before and just thought it was worth a try. now, it is the only fragrance that i wear. i have gotten so many compliments on this fragrance that it is amazing. my husband and friends call it my ""signature scent"". they know whenever i have been in a room or are near them without turning around.",4.0
"splendor is awesome!!...it smells feminine and clean, not fruity...flowery with clean!...to me, it resembled perry ellis 360 which i love!...lasts all day and smells soft as the day goes by. perfect for daytime.",4.0
"good perfume,anytime anywhere and for any use.",4.0
beautiful scent - scent of rich flowers..........i have always loved it and because it is now affordable - i love it more!,4.0
"this is the first time i've ever ordered joy. i can't explain the scent. to me, it is somewhere between natural, floral, and oriental/spicy. it is a little strong when you first put it on, but tames down as time goes by and leaves a more pleasant scent. it reminds me a little of white shoulders, but stronger with a hint of floral and spiciness to it. i can't say that this is one of my favorite perfumes. perhaps it reminds of a perfume for those who hold dear, of long ago, some very precious memories.",3.0
"joy is a timeless fragrance, just right for my own skin chemistry. i absolutely love the perfume -- haven't been able to find anything quite like it. it is pricey and so i always search for sales.",4.0
i bought this as a gift for my mother. the deal was out of this world! coyldnt find a better price anywhere else. shipping was fast too! the packaging ( i ordered without the box) was very secure. great site to order from. i have already recommended to many friends and coworkers.,4.0
no doubt the most wonderful smelling perfume in the world. joy lives up to it's name of bringing pure joy to everyone around. it was my elegant dinner out perfume and my special dates like new years perfume but i could wear it everyday and love it. nothing like it. they have taken a garden of roses and bottled it.,4.0
"joy by jean patou. the very essence and meaning of true french perfume. a wonderful experience for your nose, which immediately lets your brain feed on the beautiful scents of the worlds finest rose & jasmine oils. truly delightful.",4.0
"emporio armani is a very favorite of mine for probably 15 years or more. my sister introduced it to me. it has a very soft, sensuous smell. i get many compliments from men and women. ""mmmmm. you smell so good!"" lol! i am glad i can still find it. can only get online. the many stores i've checked do not stock it.",4.0
"armani emporio is a clean, fresh scent. it is very subtle and perfect for office, casual or formal. i receive many compliments when i wear this fragrance.",4.0
emporio armani my favorite and only for over 15 yrs. i have bought many but the only one i have ever been able to wear to to my migraines and i hope i can wear it forever! i get compliments everyday that i am out someone stops me to ask what i am wearing and i love it and proudly tell them! my husband keeps me stocked up for every holiday he to is afraid it will be discontinued and both of us will be disappointed! he loves how it smells on me and all the compliments i gets too! please keep it coming for all of your dedicated buyers!! love lots of armani products for my daughters and sons also!!! thanks again!!,4.0

"elizabeth arden provacative woman is my all time favorite & have garnered the most glowing response from strangers in the grocery store, concerts & just about anywhere .men often ask me what i'm wearing & compliment me. i hope it will always remain available! a well known pop/rock singer also noticed & liked it, as well as family & friends. i have no desire to ever change it. it's not over powering like some fragrances, but becckons to come closer. love it!!",4.0

creed love in black. the best fragrance that can be worn any time . it' sexy but classic .,4.0

"i have always worn light florals and citrus perfume. vince camuto's ciao was a nice surprise with its fruity top notes and subtle fragrance. years ago, i wore over-powering scents and cringe at the thought! another trait of ciao is that it is pleasantly light, so the whole office can't smell you before you even get there!",4.0
"to date, my favorite perfume is ""ciao"" from vince camuto!! this one makes me feel special and i get a lot of compliments from everyone at church or anywhere else that i go!!!",4.0

"i love, love pleasures intense!! beautiful lush floral scent that can be worn day or night. i've worn this perfume off and on for years. i've gotten so much compliments by a lot if people. that's how i know that it is the perfect perfume for me! i have very sensitive skin that will breakout in a rash especially the neck and chest area if i wear certain perfumes. i've tried very expensive ones from victor & rolph flower bomb to christian dior jiadore which scents i loved but got a bad skin reaction from them . i can wear estee lauders perfumes without getting that kind of reaction.",4.0

"1999 was the first time i ever smelt this scent my friend who likes trying different perfumes decided to wear it ,i couldn't stop smelling her ! hahaha! shortly after that it was my birthday and she bought me a bottle i've worn it ever since with a two year gap in there because i had trouble finding anywhere then i found fragrancenet i love you guys you've made me so happy",4.0
this is one of my old favorites! i have worn this for years!! and you can't beat the price.,4.0
i love it i used more than 10 years,4.0
i have worn this fragrance exclusively for at least 10 yrs. i can't tell you what it smells like. to me it just smells 'clean'. i know that's not a fragrance but it's the only way i can describe it. i've had so many strangers tell me they love the perfume i'm wearing. it startles me because i have even forgotten about having it on. i don't even shop for any other perfume because i'm not tired of getting compliments. *smile*,4.0
"i had been looking for a roll-on like we wore in the 70's. i found ""i fancy you"" by jessica simpson and decided to try it. i am well pleased. i like the fragrances that have a powdery scent, but like others, that is hard to do online when you can not try it out. my sons have even commented on it more than once. i have not been wearing any for a while. i even wear it when it is just me. i like the clean, fun smell that is not overwhelming. i will continue to keep on wearing it. no headache either!!",4.0
"i bought this for my sister and she absolutely loved it! every time i'd ask her what parfume she's wearing and she would tell me the one you got me, i fancy you! i loved smelling it on her so much that i am buying one for myself!",4.0

"this is a christmas gift, but i am sure my daughter will be happy as that is one of the gifts on her list.",3.0
thank you for your prompt service. received knowing perfume in record time.,4.0
knowing is one of the best perfumes i could have brought this why i want go with out it❤️love it thank u estée lauder i have everything u make,4.0
knowing by estee lauder is the only fragrance i use i highly recommend this to all ladies i do think it is nicer for a more mature lady.,4.0
"knowing is, by far, my favorite fragrance of all time! it is way different from what i normally go for as i typically prefer clean, fresh scents. i love knowing because it stays with you for hours and hours and even though it has a strong fragrance, a little definitely goes a long way, it still smells like a real woman. it is perfect for a sensual evening with your special someone. i have never worn it when at least one person asked me what i was wearing. many times, i refuse to tell them. i like to keep my fragrances different from what everyone else is wearing, but in hindsight, every woman should experience how exotic and sexy this fragrance makes you feel! even the high school students i teach, who i would assume would never be interested in something quite so strong, always tell me they love my perfume. i recommend wearing it in the evening or fall/winter months. though, i admit i have been known to wear it in the spring and summer just because i love it so much, it is, in my opinion, the best scent lauder ever concocted!",4.0

"i am obsessed with lolita perfumes so i went on a purchase frenzy and bought several of her collection. this one i must say its more of a cologne scent than a perfume scent. needles to say, its a very good scent for a man which is why my husband snatched it for himself and now loves it. best way to describe it is a soft spicy scent. hub likes spicy colognes...his other top choice is spicebomb by viktor & rolf. win win situation for me. :) if you are looking for something subtle and ""sweet"" get the l'eau en blanc (the sweetest one of her line in a powdery kind of scent) or less sweet yet amazing is her lolita lempicka perfume (in a purplish bottle packaged in a neon green box). enjoy!",4.0

lou lou is so different and sensual. iit came out in 1987 i think. the first time i smelled it was in a magazine--you know the ones with the paper insert which has the scent on it. i so longed for it and finally got to buy it when i was on a business trip in toronto. i immediately started wearing it and was struck by it's staying power and it's ability to draw people around you especially men. it was totally intoxicating. not a day went by when i wasnt asked what scent i was wearing i've had men chance me down the street or in airports to ask what i was wearing one man said it gets up in my nose and i can't forget the scent. then it disappeared and i was devestated as i never used anything else. i had the perfume deodorant and body lotion. it was pure heaven. i did find a bottle in the middle east while i was working then and i felt like i had won the lottery. i am so happy it's back as it was my signature scent,4.0
"i wore this fragrance in the nineties, but eventually switched to chanel #5 as a mainstay fragrance. recently i have been searching for a new signature scent because many of the classic perfumes no longer smell the same due to reformulations. i read a very positive review of the current version of cacherel's lou lou and tried it. i love the exotic flowery scent that gradually becomes a powdery skin smell after a few hours. everyone else seems to like it too, and it lasts well. it's just perfect and i'm so glad i found it available online after so many years.",4.0

"night by judith lieber is my new obsession :-) it was time for a new fragrance, especially for the fall/winter. i stumbled across this scent in the mysterious black bottle with jewels not knowing what to expect. on me, it smells clean and inviting in a unique and delightful way. over time, the more spicy and warm parts of this fragrance come alive in a comforting, approachable, long lasting way. so glad i found this! i wear it for any occasion. i even wear this just for myself, spritzing some on before bed. mmmmmm. :-) i rate this 5 stars!!!",4.0
"i bought the betsey johnson by betsey johnson perfume and lotion set, actually because it had decent reviews and it was cheap....i won't say it was horrible, but it is just ok...i believe this would best be worn by a young lady, even high school age....i am 54 and this was just not for me...i will pass it on to someone else who is younger.....i was kind of surprised by the scent,...thinking of betsey johnson, i thought it would be a scent that represents her...i thought it would be more classy.... i don't think this is anywhere near a great scent, but if you are in high school or college, have limited funds and want a cute scent then by all means, go for it... it is no where near the worst scent, but not amazing either,.....try it, for the cheap price you may like it....",1.0

"i recently purchased eva by eva longoria and i'm undecided about this fragrance. it's rather woodsy with green undertones and my preference is usually for floral, powdery fragrances. when you first put it on, there's an odd note that's rather off-putting, but as it dries down, it smells better. it's ok, but i i don't think i'd buy it again. i suspect the ""leather-based"" elements are giving it that ""odd note"" - it just doesn't work on me.",1.0

"i have been wearing estee for 35 years and it is a clean, mellow, lite and refreshing scent and i have never gotten tired of it. i do not work now, but when i did, i know my cologne did not overwhelm!!!! some colognes make everyone you are in contact with sick, this is rude. i believe a person should think of others when they get dressed. people forget to think about their space and the space of others, as you can tell i had parents who really believed in the golden rule! it applies to everything.",4.0

(always nice comments) it is my signature scent that's forsure people know when i have been somewhere. lets just say don't wear this perfume if you are going to commit a crime cause it will give you away. i absolutely love it, whats sad is that i can not smell it on myself. when i get home from work and go into my room where i sprayed it in the morning i smell it then. but i do not smell it on me during the day. i like to spray it at the back of my neck and a spray over the top of my head so it lands in my hair. thank you so much clinique please never stop making this perfume",4.0
"i have been in love with this fragrance for years!! it is wonderful. very long lasting. but warning, warning - this is very strong. just a spray or two will be fine for the day. there is a body smoother lotion/cream as well as the spray and it seems to me that the body smoother lotion/cream is not quite as loud but does last a very long time - if you like patchouli, you will be in heaven.",4.0
the best smell ever. always get compliments on the way you smell. a smell that you never want to run out of. if you live like i do in the house with my sisters and nieces. you have to hide it from them or they will use it all up and never mention that it's all gone. so that purpose i recommend keeping extras on hand. and suggesting to them that they buy their own. and when wearing the perfume to work. everyone wants to know what you are wearing and where did you buy it. they also want to know if it can be bought at a affordable price. it has an unique scent that will last for years and years to come. in other word it has a scent that young ladies will always seek. 5 stars,4.0

it's life it's everything that i've ever wanted. it's so ari,4.0
"love it! this fragrance is light and breezy. starts out with floral sweet fragrance (but not too sweet even for a mature woman) and ends with an earthy sandalwood aroma. not a lot of ""oil"" to it that would give it a longer staying power. but that also makes it ideal for spritzing clothes, pillows, undergarments which evaporates more slowly without leaving stains. i recommend this fragrance for everyday wear as well as for office. won't overpower co-workers who may have allergies.",4.0
"i fell in love with ck be the first time that i smelled it on a guy a few years ago. i also think it's perfect because it is unisex. i find it to have a soft and sensual scent, that lasts all day. 5 stars to ck be. i hope that this fragrance is not discontinued, as that would be very disappointing.....",4.0

"l'air du temps has been my favorite scent for most of my adult life and am never without it. newer fragrances do not have the ""classic umpf"" that does this special scent. i am of french birth so i know classic and love it. one lady asks: how to pronounce l'air du temps: it is said softly ""lair du tomp"" silent p. i, too, miss the more slender bottle",4.0

"kim kardashian is an original scent. it's warm, much like the way britany spears curious is warm, but kim k has lots of sandlewood; the sandlewood gives it a soft sweetness. the only thing that i don't like is that it doesn't last long. it's definitely a fragrance that you have to reapply every hour or so because it disappears. it's definitely a good snuggling fragrance or a really good scent for a car ride because it sits close to the skin and isn't over powering.",3.0

"juicy couture gold is mind blowingly delicious. i've purchased several excellent parfums from fragrancenet (thank you fragrancenet for the always excellent service) for my daughter, but i don't get to smell them because my daughter won't turn loose of the juicy gold. thick caramel sweetness drizzles the user with attraction. not uber sweet, so o.k. for ladies who are not teens, but really geared for the under 25 y.o. set i'd say. not a forever thing, i'd say about 5 hours worth or so, but there's little out there that can match it - maybe one of the very best gourmand scents you can lay your hands on with a great price point.",4.0
"i bought this viva la juicy gold based solely on reviews and i am so glad i did! i am in ❤ with v. l. j. gold!!!! i have worn the original viva la juicy for several years, it had been my signature scent. however prior to my buying this v. l j. gold, i had blindly bought the viva la juicy noir and i fell in love with that one as well. so now i rotate between the viva la juicy regular, the viva la juicy noir and the viva la juicy gold!!!!! excellent, excellent perfume!!!! don't hesitate, just buy it!",4.0

"i have been a nurse for about 25 years. i also started wearing design fragrance for 25 years. i bought the perfume because there was a beautiful gift with the purchased. it was a ceramic musical carousel. it was like the perfume. it was unique. while in nursing school, our supervisors told us in orientation, please don't wear perfume at your place of employment. sick people will tell you a nurse wearing perfume is the last thing you want to smell. again, anyone who is not feeling well at home will not want to smell any scents, especially if one is suffering with an upper respiratory illness. myself, out of habit, after i take a shower, i tend to spray fragrance on my arm. i began working in a hospital and chose the evening shift. i didn't wear perfume but used the bath bath gel only. the smell is so light. i wouldn't even smell it. in the evening, after i get to the hospital, i take report from the previous nurses on patients i will be taking care of that night. well, as i walked into my assigned patients rooms a patient complimented on my fragrance so much. she just couldn't get over that the smell of my perfume. i told her i wasn't wearing any. i just used the bath soap. she complimented several times how nice the fragrance was. she spoke to me about what kind of perfume was i wearing. it seemed as though the fragrance didn't bother her at all. of course, i apologized for accidently wearing that fragrance in my bath water. she said it didn't bother her at all. matter of fact she said that was the first time she ever smelled such a different perfume. she really liked it. some of the nurses and friends like the perfume so much a few purchased a bottle for themselves. so, the perfume works. the perfume, all i can say is ""i love it.' thank you paul sebastian.",4.0

i have worn burberry for years. it the type of scent that one can wear every day for any occasion. i consistently receive compliments from both men & women when i wear this scent. we all can use that extra confidence of a stranger approaching you to tell you how good you smell; and ask what are you wearing? it is the only scent i wear.,4.0
i have wore burberry for several years. i always receive compliments on how good my perfume smells. i have been told they can tell when i have walked by. what i really like about this perfume is that i can not smell it but others compliment me on how good it smells. it's not too strong. i love burberry....,4.0

"burberry. i recently came upon an article 10 women's fragrances that smell great on men and burberry was listed. upon reading “the intense fizzy, fruity jasmine can sit unashamedly sophisticated on the right man. after all, dior homme is nothing but a straight-up iris-based fragrance, so give jasmine a chance here and wear it with a crisp white shirt.” i was sold. i ordered it without even sampling and i was elated with the fragrance! another stiller fragrance added to my repertoire of alluring and intoxicating fragrances!",4.0
"burberry: this has and always be a very complimenting perfume. being there is not a day that you wear it somebody doesn't ask, ""what perfume are you wearing - it smells amazing"". to each his own on what they like....but don't think you will be disappointed with this",4.0

dkny be delicious does not quite fit into the above 6 categories. it stands alone as a woman's perfume. i believe their is just a touch of cucumber in delicious perfumes ingredients. i wear it 24/7 and would like dk to come out with be delicious (affordable) deodorant. i also believe dkny be delicious was made just for me. thank you dk i truly appreciate what your perfume does for me.,4.0
"1in dkny ""be delicious"", i've found a scent so wonderful that it is truly all i'll ever need or want to wear. it is a scent so magical, strangers have stopped me on the street to ask what i am wearing. and of course, as all truly great perfume, it is unique for each wearer as it melds with ones own body chemistry. light, fresh, like flower & fruit, but not overly ""sweet"". perfectly ""delicious""! best price on the web too!",4.0
"i started wearing dkny be delicious when it first came out and i still love it! i receive more compliments when wearing it than any other fragrance i've ever worn. i call it ""my scent."" it's a very refreshing scent that lasts all day but not overwhelming. try it-you won't be disappointed!",4.0

"i read the reviews before i purchased this fragrance, and not just from this site. i decided to try something new, which for me is very unusual. i absolutely love jimmy choo! it smells very exotic and yet sweet and natural on me. i am lucky in that i can wear almost any fragrance without having the issue of my skin effecting the chemistry of the scent. i had smelled jimmy choo flash body wash at my sister's and was at first leaning toward buying it, but after reading the reviews, they changed my mind. thank you all for your reviews! this is a big part of why i usually leave a review when i really like/dislike a product. also, thank you fragrancenet for the amazing prices! you guys do have the best prices.",4.0
i tried this perfume on a test paper at the department store. i loved it. so for christmas i asked my friend (when he asked me what i wanted for a gift) if he would get as a gift. i love jimmy choo. so he got the biggest bottle they have. it last longer and doesnt fade out as many others do. it is a delicious sent. i get so many complements from strangers in the store. i feel very feminine when i ware it.,4.0

romance is a bit pricey but well worth every cent. it's a comforting scent and will get people walking by you and asking what is that cologne you have on it smells wonderful. i really am behind romance all the way. if you love cinnabar by estee lauder you will love romance.,4.0

"i am a true perfume connoisseur, and can honestly say that this is really a great scent! my burberry black offers you a unique fragrance - i prefer this one over my burberry, although equally beautiful and worth owning & enjoying, just a matter of preference. my burberry black is warmer and deeper in notes over my burberry, and let's not mention that they both last practically all day!! black is perfect for any occasion, but you may want to apply only a few sprays during day use and confined environments. for evening and special events, apply as you like. test them both out in the store and then you choose. either way, you will not be disappointed! five stars for sure!",4.0
