It was a bargain. “How odd”, I thought “ a perfumery with the same name as the opera singer..” lol. Now, I don’t know how involved ol’ Golden Pipes the Maestro was in the making of this perfume, but it is quite gorgeous. It is fruity and luscious, with a slight greeny mellow herby tone. It is Tuscany summers, fruit orchards, sunlit bedrooms, hot terracotta tiles, lemons, wine, honey. I like to think Luciano made this for his daughters, to make them smile when he wasn’t there.

       "  'Julliete Has A Gun creates another amazing elixir, very Unisex. Quick break down of motes. Metal Chypre by Juliette Has A Gun is a Chypre fragrance for women and men. Metal Chypre was launched in 2017. The nose behind this fragrance is Romano Ricci. Top notes are Pink Pepper and Bergamot; middle notes are Suede, iris, Patchouli and Amber; base notes are Ambroxan, White Musk and Tonka Bean. Very smooth and warm, the pink pepper on top with the Bergamot catches your attention but the smooth middle of Suede. Iris, earthiness of the Patchouli and Amber makes it so wonderfully wearable for box sexes. Bit what lingers is the amazing sweet Ambroxen white Must and Tonka Bean . Only me (male) it gave me 8 hours easily, but I did spray 5 times. My wife was light with just 3 sprays. Though a beautiful warm scent i can easily wear this at work in the office if your a white collar type, but great to spray once or twice if your heading out for drinks or dinner after work. I feel more inclined to wear this in the Fall or Winter but is just at home being used on a formal night out out especially on cooler Spring or Summer nights. Excellent choice for those rainy Spring or Summer days. JHAG created a lovely beast of a fragrance. Was a big fan of the original JHAG \"Not a Petfume\" this must be tied for the ky 2 favorites, including my wife\\'s choice!! ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Review by Capturedbyfire',\n",

We both love it and I use it too from time to time. This perfume stands out from the crowd of many generic nowadays perfumes. It is floral sweet, no bubblegum sweet, no sugary sweet, just a very good rounded sweet smell of flowers, like stepping into garden in Spring. But when it dries down, like a chameleon, it changes direction to something to woody-musky-vanilla like sent. Completely feminine perfume, never mind for that woody undertone. It is a Masterpiece that not so many people know of, and maybe because of that it is not so popular. People always ask what she is wearing, complement her how much they like the scent, try to sniff closely and match with other \"there\" perfumes. But none, none would guess what it is. IMO, I\\'d say Kundalini has the \\'80 vibe, with its strong and distinctive personality. It is Autumn-Spring perfume, will be overpowering in the Summer.

A totally nice balance of woody, musky, floral with mimosa carrying the day. One Love deserves its high score on Fragrantica. It's very French, very fresh, and utterly original. To me it doesn't smell synthetic at all. One of those below-the-radar perfumes that I love to collect. Has the same violet leaf note as Jaipur Bracelet and a similar aromatic, green freshness. MORE than worth its price!!\",\n",

It is delicate without being powdery, luxurious without being heavy and/or musky. It is a top-notch perfume without any brassy or off-notes like you find in lesser quality scents. You can wear it year-round, day or evening, as it is well-balanced. It lasts long without being too strong and always, always gets complements when I wear it. I adore fine perfumes, and this one is in my top 5.',\n",

I smell the Dasmus rose, which is a intoxicating rose, deep lovely rose. I also smelling. creamy florals. Then the drydown is sandalwood, vanilla and oud. Warm drydown and rose stays around. I still smelled a creamy slightly rose smell the next afternoon after spraying at 5 in the evening the previous day. On my shirt I sprayed a few days later to try it that way. I was blown away.

It’s like you just showered with the best perfectly balanced fresh/floral shower gel. Although I feel like it’s more on the fresh side...which is probably why I love it so much because I’m typically not a fan of floral scents. It’s the the perfect balance. The only downside to this fragrance is that it fades too quickly. I won’t smell it through out the day much if anything at all. It is an Eau de toilette but I have other Eau de toilettes that perform better through the day. So is you’re okay with reapplying through the day then I do recommend this fragrance.

Perfect for a young woman and beyond, Ajmal Entice 2 is one of the most feminine and elegant perfumes I've ever smelled....and the price?! They could have slapped a $290 price tag on this perfume (I'm looking at you Roja Elixir Pour Femme) and I still would have said it was worth it. It does smell similar to Elixir Pour Femme from Roja...not a dupe!! But same vibe as Elixir Pour Femme. This is just stunning and I'll be raving about this one for a while. Ajmal Entice 2 is perfect for Spring and Summer months and can even be worn into the first month of Fall. Longevity is fantastic at about 8 hours on skin and even more on clothes. Projection is incredible as well. This is a must for any rose lover or any lover of fruity floral perfumes. Truly beautiful.\"},\n",
